# Overview

Creates a database of quotes in the cloud. It stores both spiritual and motivational quotes and allows you to add, edit type of quote and status. 

I have always wanted to build a cloud based quote capture system.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running, a walkthrough of the code, and a view of the cloud database.}
